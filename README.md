## 🔐 End-to-End Encryption

An implementation of secure end-to-end encryption that ensures data privacy and confidentiality during communication. This project demonstrates how encryption and decryption can be applied in real-world applications to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## 📌 Features

✅ End-to-End encryption of messages

✅ Secure key generation and exchange

✅ AES/RSA encryption algorithms

✅ Simple and user-friendly implementation

✅ Protects data confidentiality and integrity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

cryptography / pycryptodome for encryption

socket (if networking is implemented)

tkinter / flask (if GUI or web support is included)
